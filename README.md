# SpaceX GraphQL Example

Basic example of a React application using GraphQL to fetch SpaceX launch data.

Outline of objectives prior to development:

-   Define a GraphQL query to fetch ‘launches’ data from https://api.spacex.land/graphql/.
-   Create a custom hook to perform the data fetch.
-   Define a reducer to handle the state of the fetched data.
-   Create a context both to pass the fetched data as needed within the app and update the data to be arranged by launch date.
