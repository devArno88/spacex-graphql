Basic example of a React application using GraphQL to fetch SpaceX launch data.

GraphQL query example can be found at https://studio.apollographql.com/public/spacex-l4uc6p/variant/main/explorer

Outline of objectives prior to development:

-   Define a GraphQL query to fetch launch data.
-   Create a custom hook to perform the data fetch.
-   Define a reducer to handle the state of the fetched data.
-   Create a context both to pass the fetched data as needed within the app and update the data to be arranged by launch date.
